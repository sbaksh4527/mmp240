 <p class="first"> Watch the American sitcom everyone has been raving about. This show is historically funny. It tells the tale of the blue collar worker, Peter, and his family which consists of Louis, Meg, Brian, Stewie, and Chris. Peter's clumsiness and ignorance is what drives the show's ratings through the roof and really helps this show be a gem for all comedy lovers. </p>
